Welcome
=======

This book is a tutorial for [Menpo](https://github.com/menpo/menpo) computer vision and machine learning library.

### This Book

This book focuses on explaining the core Menpo abstractions and datatypes which are heavily reused throughout all of the Menpo Project. If you are new to the project, this book is the best way to quickly get up to speed with how to use Menpo.

### API Reference

This book is one of two parts of Menpo's documentation, the other being the [API Reference](http://docs.menpo.org/en/stable/). The API Reference is a complete technical description about how every function and method operates in Menpo ([example](http://docs.menpo.org/en/stable/api/menpo/io/import_images.html)). The API Reference is the place to go if you want to know exactly how an individual component functions in Menpo.

The API Reference is generated from docstrings in the source code, so you can also use the `?` IPython magic to check the documentation of a function whilst working interactively:
```py
import menpo
menpo.io.import_images?<Enter>
```
