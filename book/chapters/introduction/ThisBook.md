# This Book

As is hopefully now clear, the core concepts and datatypes defined in `menpo` are reused across all of the Menpo Project. We've worked hard to keep this core API as compact as possible, as we know from experience it's never pleasant trying to get to grips with another projects sprawling API and design patterns if you just want to get a job done.

The rest of this book is devoted to getting you to grips with the core `menpo` concepts and abstractions as quickly as possible. If you are at all interested in using any part of the Menpo Project, the 15 minutes it will take you to read through this book will be hugely beneficial to getting started quickly.

There will be examples throughout, and in fact all future pages of this book will be generated from an IPython notebook, so you can install Menpo, and follow along, trying and tweaking examples as you go.

As a final note, if you are only interested in using Menpo as a black box for some of the MenpoFit functionality, you are invited to checkout `menpocli`, our Command Line Interface. This is a cross platform set of executables for performing landmark detection on images, and requires no knowledge of Python or the rest of this book.
